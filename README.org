So, it is [[http://www.pokemon20.com/][Pokemon Day]]! The 20th anniversary of the release of the
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Red_and_Blue][original Pokemon games in Japan]]. It is also a very special day for me!

Why?

Because today, I am going to start one of the original Pokemon games
in Japanese! My new year's resolution this year was to be able to read
Japanese, so I am hard at work getting up to speed with the language.

I decided I wanted to try to do this, partially because I wanted to
have a project to stay resolved, and partially because I wanted to see
if I could do it...

* How will it work?
I will play through Pokemon Green and, armed with a few tools, my
current Japanese knowledge, and some persistence, I will play and
[[file:./translation.md][translate as I go along]].

Each time I save and stop, I will make a Git commit with my save file,
as well as some notes about what I accomplished.

So! Let the games begin!
